Comparison amongst the same filter in the case when L=wmax and L=wmax/2
In both the cases of cosine filtering and shepp logan filtering, we can observe that 
the images in case of wmax are much clearer (grayscale) and approximate the colors
(in colorscale wrt to original image) as compared to that of the case when L=wmax/2.

This is justified as in case of wmax/2 we attenuate the frequencies higher than wmax/2, but 
since the highest freq observed in fft is wmax, we are essentially attenuating important datapoints.

In case of wmax we attenuate frequencies higher than wmax, and thus we donot attenuate
datapoints which are important and hence the image is sharper/clearer in this case.

Comparison amongst the filters themselves:
As can be clearly seen from the Cosine filter is better than the shepp logan 
which is better than the ram lak filter.
