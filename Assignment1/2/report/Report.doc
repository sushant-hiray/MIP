Comparison amongst the same filter in the case when L=wmax and L=wmax/2
In both the cases of cosine filtering and shepp logan filtering, we can observe that 
the images in case of wmax are much clearer (grayscale) and approximate the colors
(in colorscale wrt to original image) as compared to that of the case when L=wmax/2.

This is justified as in case of wmax/2 we attenuate the frequencies higher than wmax/2, but 
since the highest freq observed in fft is wmax, we are essentially attenuating important datapoints.

In case of wmax we attenuate frequencies higher than wmax, and thus we donot attenuate
datapoints which are important and hence the image is sharper/clearer in this case.

Comparison amongst the filters themselves:
As can be clearly seen from the images, Cosine filter is better than the shepp logan.
Cosine betters shepp logan because it doesn't amplify higher frequencies.

Since there is no noise in the data, the ram lak filter gives the best image in this case.

Also, even though there is no noise in the data, cosine and shepp logan filter change the fft values corresponding
to each frequency, hence the image formed by shepp logan and the cosine filters is not better than ramlak.


When noise is added, ramlak performs worse than cosine and shepplogan as it doesn't suppress very high frequencies.
In this situation cosine and shepp logan perform better.
